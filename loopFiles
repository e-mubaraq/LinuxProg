# set var to all the directories that have a space in them

var=`find . -type d -name '* *'`

#set the special variable so that the field separator to a new line instead of a space

IFS=$'\n'

# First do all the directories, then do all the file



# loop through each directory, separated by a newlines (not spaces!)
#

for f in $var
do
    echo $f # instead of echo, remove the spaces!!
done

# now you write the code to do the same thing, but with the files (not directories)
